/**
 * Highest Scoring Word
 * 
 * Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

 * Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

 * For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

 * You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

 * If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

 * All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
 * 
 * @param { string } str
 * @returns { string }
